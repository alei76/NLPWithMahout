Introduction
============

The bitterlemons corpus consists of the articles published on the
bitterlemons website < http://www.bitterlemons.org> from late 2001 to
early 2005.  The website is set up to "contribute to mutual
understanding [between Palestinians and Israelis] through the open
exchange of ideas." (See
<http://www.bitterlemons.org/about/about.html>) Every week an issue
about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is selected for discussion
(e.g., "Disengagement: unilateral or coordinated?"), and a Palestinian
editor and an Israeli editor contribute one article addressing the
issue.  In addition, the Israeli and Palestinian editors invite one
Israeli and one Palestinian to express their views on the issue
(sometimes in the form of an interview), resulting in four articles in
an weekly edition.  Each article is labeled as written from either a
Palestinian or an Israeli perspective by the editors.

The bitterlemons corpus was collected by Theresa Wilson and Wei-Hao
Lin to study the problem of identifying perspectives from which a
document is written.  More details about their research can be found
in the following paper,

|   author = 	 {Wei-Hao Lin and Theresa Wilson and Janyce Wiebe and Alexander Hauptmann},
|   title = 	 {Which Side are You on? Identifying Perspectives at the Document and Sentence Levels},
|   year = 	 2006,
|   booktitle = 	 {Proceedings of Tenth Conference on Natural Language Learning ({CoNLL})}

The two editors of the bitterlemons.org web site agree to release the
corpus for research purpose.  Please give proper credit to the authors
and the bitterlemons website when using the corpus.  For any other use

Corpus
======

The bitterlemons corpus is organized as follows,

- README 
- docs/
- meta/
- html/

The original articles (in HTML) downloaded from bitterlemons.org are
stored in html/.  Each HTML file is a weekly issue and contains four
articles.  Each article is extracted and saved under docs/ after HTML
tags are removed.  There are a total of 594 articles in docs/.  The
metadata of the articles (e.g., author, summary, edition number, etc)
are also removed.  Metadata are saved under meta/, and filenames under
meta/ match those under docs/.  For example, the file
``meta/bl010903ed33is2`` contains the metadata of the article
``docs/bl010903ed33is2``.

There are five fields in the metadata files:

- Field 1: serial numbers starting from 0
- Field 2: always "0,0"
- Field 3: always "string"
- Field 4: types of metadata
- Field 5 (and the rest of the line): value for the type in Field 4

Viewpoints are either Palestinian or Israeli.
